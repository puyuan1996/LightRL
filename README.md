## Overview

LightRL is an RL post-training framework for training language-model agents in
interactive environments. Each experiment is composed explicitly along four
axes, making recipes easy to inspect, reproduce, and extend:

| Axis | Current options | Entry point |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Harness | Camel-Agent, Claude Code CLI | `agentic_rl/harnesses/` |
| Environment | SETA, Agent-SafetyBench, AgentHarm, tau2, SWE-smith / SWE-verified | `agentic_rl/environments/` |
| Model | Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-30B-A3B, GLM-5.1 | `configs/rollout/` |
| Algorithm | GRPO / DAPO, DIVE-PO | Slime backend and `agentic_rl/algorithms/` |

LightRL bundles the Slime and Megatron-LM training backends. Terminal
environments run in isolated Docker workers and are accessed by training
processes over HTTP. A worker may run on a dedicated CPU/Docker host or on the
same host as GPU training; colocated deployments must reserve sufficient CPU,
memory, Docker-network, and port capacity.

## Core capabilities

- **Recipe-driven training** — every experiment is a reviewable shell script;
  `--dry-run` exposes the resolved data, model, parallelism, and backend command.
- **Agentic environments** — covers SETA, Agent-SafetyBench, AgentHarm, tau2,
  and SWE-smith / SWE-verified, with terminal tasks isolated in Docker workers.
- **Explicit algorithm boundaries** — GRPO / DAPO come from the bundled Slime
  backend; LightRL maintains DIVE-PO and the PRM reward agent under
  `agentic_rl/algorithms/`.
- **Low-cost extension** — environments, harnesses, and reward post-processors
  have centralized registration points instead of scattered conditionals.
- **Operational observability** — turn-level trajectories, JSONL metrics, W&B
  curves, config snapshots, and dataset manifests share `runs/<RUN_ID>/`.
- **Bounded end-to-end checks** — 4-GPU smoke recipes cover rollout, reward
  shaping, and actor updates without requiring a full training run.

## Execution model

```text
Recipe script
  → Slime launcher: data preparation, worker discovery, command assembly
  → Rollout hook: harness + inference + environment interaction
  → Reward shaping: score construction and optional DIVE-PO post-processing
  → Actor update: training through Slime / Megatron-LM
```

Terminal tasks require a Docker-capable worker exposed through `WORKER_URLS`.
The worker may run on a dedicated CPU/Docker host or on the current GPU training
host. Colocation is suitable for a resource-rich single machine, provided
Docker containers and training processes do not contend for CPU, memory, disk,
or ports. A single worker is contacted directly; multiple workers, or an
explicit `START_ENV_POOL_SERVER=1`, enable the local lease router.

## Architecture

```text
examples/training/<recipe>.sh
  → agentic_rl/platform/slime_train.sh          # stable public launcher
      ├─ slime_train/lib_*.sh                    # 7 phases: dirs, config, data, worker, args, launch
      └─ slime/train_async.py                    # GRPO / DAPO backend
          → agentic_rl/rollout/entrypoint.generate
              ├─ environments/registry.py       # source, runtime, and reward policy registry
              ├─ harnesses/factory.py           # Camel-Agent / Claude Code factory
              ├─ rollout/backends/sglang.py     # shared sglang turn client
              ├─ rollout/generate_steps.py      # multi-turn loop, scoring, exploration
              └─ rollout/sample_builder.py      # reward shaping → Sample.reward["score"]
          → algorithms/dive_po/rewards/dual_stream
                                                   # optional group-normalized post-process
```

The launcher loads `lib_bootstrap`, `lib_run_dir`, `lib_rollout_cfg`,
`lib_dataset`, `lib_worker`, `lib_args`, and `lib_launch` in order. Recipes rely
only on the stable `slime_train.sh` entry point, keeping project logic separate
from third-party backend details.

## Installation and requirements

- Python ≥ 3.10.
- Real training requires a prepared runtime with CUDA, Slime, Megatron-LM, and
  model checkpoints.
- SETA and other terminal tasks require a Docker-capable worker, either on a
  dedicated CPU host or on the current GPU training host.
- Training processes must reach the worker service port (default `18081`);
  use `127.0.0.1` for colocation or a training-reachable address across hosts.
- Keep site addresses, credentials, and scheduling parameters in environment
  variables or git-ignored `local/cluster/` files.

Install the Python package from source:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e '.[rollout,worker,train]'
python3 -c 'import agentic_rl'
```

This installs the Python package and selected optional dependencies only. It
does not provision CUDA, model weights, or the cluster runtime required by
Slime and Megatron-LM.

## Quickstart

### 1. Start and configure a worker

Start the worker on the selected Docker host, which may be a dedicated CPU node
or the current GPU training node. See the
[Docker worker guide](deploy/workers/README.md) for capacity, prewarming, and
operations. On an already prepared machine, start the default pool server from
the repository root:

```bash
bash deploy/workers/run_pool_server_pu_v2.sh
```

Then configure and check the endpoint in the training shell:

```bash
export WORKER_URLS=http://<WORKER_HOST>:18081
curl --noproxy '*' --fail http://<WORKER_HOST>:18081/healthz
```

Use `127.0.0.1` for `<WORKER_HOST>` when worker and training run on the same
host. For remote deployment, use a reachable IP or hostname. Supply multiple
workers as a comma-separated `WORKER_URLS`, or use `WORKER_URLS_FILE`.

### 2. Inspect a recipe

The maintained entry points are listed below. `examples/training/world_model/`
is WIP and is not a stable training recipe.

| Recipe | Harness | Model | Environment | Algorithm |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `train_qwen3_8b_seta_dapo.sh` | Camel-Agent | Qwen3-8B | SETA | DAPO |
| `train_qwen3_8b_seta_dive_po.sh` | Camel-Agent | Qwen3-8B | SETA | DIVE-PO |
| `train_qwen3_8b_mixed_dapo.sh` | Camel-Agent | Qwen3-8B | SETA + Agent-SafetyBench + AgentHarm | DAPO |
| `train_glm_5_1_seta_dapo.sh` | Camel-Agent | GLM-5.1 | SETA | DAPO |

Run `--dry-run` in the GPU training environment to inspect the resolved data,
model, parallelism, and backend command:

```bash
bash examples/training/train_qwen3_8b_seta_dapo.sh --dry-run
bash examples/training/train_qwen3_8b_seta_dive_po.sh --dry-run
bash examples/training/train_qwen3_8b_mixed_dapo.sh --dry-run
bash examples/training/train_glm_5_1_seta_dapo.sh --dry-run
```

### 3. Launch training

```bash
WORKER_URLS=http://<WORKER_HOST>:18081 \
NUM_GPUS=4 ACTOR_GPUS=2 ROLLOUT_GPUS=2 TP_SIZE=2 \
ROLLOUT_NUM_GPUS_PER_ENGINE=2 \
bash examples/training/train_qwen3_8b_seta_dapo.sh
```

Override the run name with `RUN_ID`. With `BACKGROUND=1`, launcher logs are
written to `runs/<RUN_ID>/launcher.log`. The GLM-5.1 recipe additionally needs
valid `HF_CKPT`, `REF_LOAD`, and compatible `MODEL_ARGS_FILE` values. See
[training examples](examples/README.md) for the maintained entry points.

### 4. Run source-level checks

```bash
python3 -m compileall -q agentic_rl
python3 -m pytest tests/agentic_rl -q
WORKER_URLS=http://127.0.0.1:18081 \
  bash examples/training/train_qwen3_8b_seta_dapo.sh --dry-run
```

Cluster-specific launchers and smoke wrappers stay in ignored local
configuration because they contain site topology and paths.

## Configuration and outputs

### Training configuration

Training defaults are defined in the recipe scripts. Environment-variable
parsing is centralized in `agentic_rl/env.py`; the `ENV_VARS` table
documents the rollout-side variables. Environment and data-source capabilities
are declared in the `EnvSpec` table in `agentic_rl/environments/registry.py`,
while rollout model templates live in `configs/rollout/`. Environment variables
override recipe defaults; see [configuration](docs/configuration.md) for fields,
precedence, and examples.

Keep site-specific addresses, credentials, proxies, and scheduler capacity out
of public recipes. Provide them through environment variables or git-ignored
`local/cluster/` files.

### Output layout

Each run writes to `runs/<RUN_ID>/`:

```text
runs/<RUN_ID>/
├── config/                # resolved config snapshot and dataset manifests
├── environment_outputs/   # environment-side AgentRunner outputs
├── logs/                  # train.log, metrics.jsonl, and launcher logs
├── trajectories/          # per-sample traj.json and side-channel index.jsonl
└── metrics/               # W&B and offline analysis artifacts
```

`runs/latest` points to the most recent run. Runtime artifacts belong under
`runs/`, not at the repository root. See
[checkpoint and W&B storage](docs/operations/checkpoint_wandb_storage_zh.md) for
storage conventions.

## Validation status

The latest bounded validation (2026-08-07, 4 GPUs, after the P0–P2 refactor)
reported:

- SETA + DAPO: 3 rollouts, 6 actor training steps, finite non-zero updates, and
  the `TRAINING_METRICS_OK` marker.
- SETA + DIVE-PO: 3 rollouts, 7 actor steps, and 4 non-zero updates; complete
  trajectory artifacts were exported with `EXAMPLE_VALIDATION_OK`.
- Mixed SETA + Agent-SafetyBench + AgentHarm with DAPO: 8 metric records,
  4 actor training steps, 4 non-zero updates, and `EXAMPLE_VALIDATION_OK`.

These are short-horizon correctness checks, not convergence or benchmark
results.

## Development and extension

Common source-level checks:

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/ -q
python3 -m compileall -q agentic_rl
```

- **Environment** — register an `EnvSpec` in
  `agentic_rl/environments/registry.py` and implement the
  `environments/protocol.py:EnvClient` contract. Runtime selection, scoring,
  safety rewards, and trajectory aliases are centralized in the registry.
- **Harness** — add `_HARNESS_ALIASES` / `_HARNESS_TARGETS` entries in
  `agentic_rl/harnesses/factory.py` and implement the
  `rollout/runner.py:RolloutAgent` protocol. Lazy imports isolate optional
  dependencies.
- **Reward post-processing** — expose `post_process_rewards(args, samples)`
  and set `CUSTOM_REWARD_POST_PROCESS_PATH` to its import path.
- **Training recipe** — reuse the stable launcher in `examples/training/` and a
  model template from `configs/rollout/`; keep site paths and credentials local.
